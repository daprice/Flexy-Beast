Flexy Beast
===========

The Flexy Beast is a wrist-powered prosthetic hand for the [e-NABLE Project](http://enablingthefuture.org). This is a mashup of the [Parametric Cyborg Beast](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:320173) by MakerBlock and the [Flexy Hand](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:380665) by Steve Wood/Gyrobot. Like the Flexy-Hand, the Flexy Beast uses flexible joints to replace the Chicago screws and elastics used on previous e-NABLE designs. This makes the hand lightweight, less expensive, better looking, more adaptable for smaller sizes, and easier to assemble and use.

I recommend using Filaflex or [molded silicone flex joints](https://github.com/daprice/Flexy-Joint/tree/FlexyBeast) for this design. See the [Flexy Joint wiki](https://github.com/daprice/Flexy-Joint/wiki) for information about materials to use and the process of making these joints.

### Finger Pads
The Flexy Beast fingers can be made with silicone finger pads for improved grip. These finger pads are designed to be easily removeable and replaceable by hand, but attach firmly enough to stay on during use.

## Hand Assembly
See the [ThingDoc documentation for the Flexy Beast](http://daprice.github.io/Flexy-Beast) for detailed sizing and assembly instructions.


## Future Improvements
* Flexible joints for gauntlet attachment (this is currently unchanged from the original Cyborg Beast)
* Possible aesthetic options such as text, decorative elements, superhero themes, etc.
