Flexy Beast
===========

The Flexy Beast is a wrist-powered prosthetic hand for the [e-NABLE Project](http://enablingthefuture.org). This is a mashup of the [Parametric Cyborg Beast](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:320173) by MakerBlock and the [Flexy Hand](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:380665) by Steve Wood/Gyrobot. Like the Flexy-Hand, the Flexy Beast uses flexible joints to replace the Chicago screws and elastics used on previous e-NABLE designs. This makes the hand lightweight, less expensive, better looking, more adaptable for smaller sizes, and easier to assemble and use.

I recommend using [molded silicone flex joints](https://github.com/daprice/Flexy-Joint/tree/FlexyBeast) for this design. See the [Flexy Joint wiki](https://github.com/daprice/Flexy-Joint/wiki) for information about materials to use and the process of making these joints.

## Assembly
Most of the sizing and assembly process follows the [standard Cyborg Beast assembly instructions](http://enablingthefuture.org/upper-limb-prosthetics/cyborg-beast/). The following only covers the assembly of the fingers.

1. Print the palm, thumb base, thumb tip, and four each of the finger base, middle, and tip. These can be scaled as needed using the x-, y-, and zScaleFactor variables in the OpenSCAD code.
2. After making the 3D printed parts and flexible joints, slide a flex joint into the proximal end of each finger, then use a flat screwdriver or other thin, flat tool to insert the other end of the joint into the corresponding slot on the next inner segment.
3. Route a string through the holes in the palm and finger (these may need to be drilled out slightly) and tie it off at the fingertip.

## Future Improvements
* Silicone finger pads for improved grip
* Flexible joints for gauntlet attachment (this is currently unchanged from the original Cyborg Beast)
* Possible aesthetic options such as text, decorative elements, superhero themes, etc.
